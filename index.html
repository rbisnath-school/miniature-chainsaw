                <h1>Huckleberry (a.k.a. "Dog-face" because he has the face of a "dog")</h1>

                <p>Huckleberry is a morkie. While technically a dog, he's actually more like cat. <span class="whisper">(Don't tell him I said that.)</span></p>

                <p>Huckleberry hates squirrels and raccoons. He once tried to fight a raccoon that was twice his size. We had a long conversation about why taking on a wild animal twice his size was not in his best interests but he's not a good listener. </p>

                <p>Huckleberry doesn't like rap music that much and will often leave the room if someone is playing said "rap" music. </p>

                <p>Huckleberry really likes cheese. For instance, if he hears the wrapper tear from a cheese string snack, he will stop whatever he's doing (quarrelling with raccoons in the yard, hanging out in a laundry basket etc.) and will beg for a piece.  </p>
